This folder contains the main Matlab codes/files for image processing used in the paper “A new bacterial transport mechanism induced by biosurfactants and corners” by Judy Q. Yang, Joseph E. Sanfilippo,  Zemer Gitai, Bonnie L. Bassler, and Howard A. Stone. Below is a list of the files:

1. Corner_Flow_climbing.m: the file used to identify the fluorescent bacterial solution and estimate the height of the tip of the corner flow. 

2. Surface_tensiometer_main_file.m: the file used to estimate the surface tension of a solution using the pendant drop method described by Rotenberg et al. (1983).

3. Corner_Flow_climbing.m: the file used to estimate the contact angle of an advancing on a PDMS surface.
